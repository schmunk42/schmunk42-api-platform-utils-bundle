### Extracted from ZA7
The following components were extracted and refactored from the ZA7 project:
- `App\Service\UuidResolver` → `Schmunk42\ApiPlatformUtils\Service\UuidResolver`
- `App\Service\CredentialEncryption` → `Schmunk42\ApiPlatformUtils\Service\CredentialEncryption`
- `App\OpenApi\RelationFieldSchemaDecorator` → `Schmunk42\ApiPlatformUtils\OpenApi\RelationFieldSchemaDecorator`
- `App\EventSubscriber\AddHydraOperationsSubscriber` → `Schmunk42\ApiPlatformUtils\EventSubscriber\AddHydraOperationsSubscriber`

### Changed
- RelationFieldSchemaDecorator: Made API prefix configurable (was hardcoded to '/api')
- RelationFieldSchemaDecorator: Made label property candidates configurable (was hardcoded constant)

- Both decorators now use constructor injection for configuration parameters

### Technical Details
